mdrenamer
=========

*NOTE*: This is quite outdated and not recommended to look at anymore. Recent versions of MD make renaming a whole lot easier.

**Description**: Command line tool version of MDRenamer for renaming Halo full maps to MD format.

**Usage**: mdrenamer.py <*input_map*> <*mod_name*> <*short_name*> <*build_number*> [*output_directory*]

**Example**: python mdrenamer.py ~/Desktop/Maps/bloodgulch.map "Best Mod" bestmod 1

**Arguments**:

<*input_map*> The file path to the Halo map file to rename

<*mod_name*> The user friendly name of the mod. Must be <= 13 characters; truncate if necessary. This is not the same as the name that shows up in the MD database, but the one that shows in the map selection menu in-game.

<*short_name*> The internal name of the mod that will be used in the outputting filename. Must be all lowercase and >= 1 character(s)

<*build_number*> The build number of the mod which is also used in the outputting filename. This should be increased before any sort of public or private distribution. Must be an integer >= 1

[*output_directory*] The directory to output the new MD renamed map in. This is optional and defaults to the directory <*input_map*> is in.

**Additional Constraints**:

string_length(<*short_name*>) + string_length(<*build_number*>) < 13

**System Requirements:**

* Python 2.7.x or 3.x (check *python --version* in a terminal)
